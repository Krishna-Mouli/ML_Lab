# ML_Lab
ML Programs, make sure to install pip, the python package installer, without that forget your ML lab, and also make sure to have pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib and other relevent packages installed
it's simple to install pip, just type this in your CMD (RUN CMD as Admin just in case) "python get-pip.py" and "python -m pip install --upgrade pip" to update your current version make sure that you are running pip version 20 or above.
